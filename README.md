# Melbourne Price Predictor - Final Project

For this project, we have used Machine Learning to predict house prices in Melbourne and in order to assess whether or not current house listings are over or undervalued. We have combined this with the Victorian crime rates as this would provide further insight in whether crime rates affect house prices. This will help a potential house buyer whether or not to bid on a property. 


## Heroku deployment

The project has been deployed to Heroku and is available [here](https://melbpricepredictor.herokuapp.com/)

## The Team 

- Catherine Sloan: https://github.com/catherinesloan
- Danielle Cahill: https://github.com/dan1ellec
- Anne Wieggers: https://github.com/annewieggers
- Tom Peddlesden: https://github.com/tomjp90 
- Joe Quinn: https://github.com/joeq94

## Data sources 
We have used the following datasources:
- Training data:
[Melbourne house prices](https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market?select=Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv)

- Testing data: 
[Domain](https://www.domain.com.au/)

We have supplemented the house price data with the Victorian crime rates, which can be found [here](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/crime-by-location-data-table)

## Overview repository

## Steps

1. Retrieving training dataset
- Data cleaning (such as dropping non relevant columns and null values, merging dataframes)

2. Retrieving testing data through scraping 
- Retrieve page with ChromeDriverManager and get URL
- Parse URL into BeautifulSoup to scrape data
- Initialise browser / return house features

3. Create Flask app to create routes to the relevant data points used
- Creating routes for index.html
	- Route to render index.html
	- Route to trigger the scrape function (parse in Domain URL and scrape info from website)

4. Setting up model 
- Using XG Boost in order to train and test the model
	- read in csvs
	- correlation matrix
	- assign data to x and y values
	- convert categorial data (suburbs) to numbers through one-hot encoding/get_dummies
	- scaling and normalisation
	- fit the model to the scaled training data and make predictions using the scaled test data

5. Prepare web page 
-	About page with prediction app
-	Team and skills page
-	Data page

6. Heroku deployment

## Caveats
-	Dropped columns that had nulls/NAs. 
-	Bedrooms 2 came from other source to ignored and used number of rooms instead
-	What date to scrape and pass in to the model for the prediction. Not all listings are auctions so we donâ€™t know the date that they will sell. Using the date the prediction is made instead. 


## Challenges and potential improvements

Challenges encountered:
- 	Data availability (limited to Melbourne and 2016-2018 only)
- 	Linear regression wasn't a suitable approach for ML (negative R2 values) so other options had to be 
-	Domain.com.au blocks web scraping through BeautifulSoup

Potential improvements:
- 	More recent data to make a more accurate model
- 	Extending the app to predict from other resources such as realestate.com
- 	The opportunity to compare multiple houses on the website
